### Hi, I'm Jay

I don't have real life since I was 15 y.o and discovered programming with Java to build Minecraft mods, actually I'm 20 y.o and I don't have life behind programming, in job I'm Software Engineer and then when I comeback to home I'm trying to help other open-source projects and build my own projects.

#### The `funFacts[]`

Maybe it's fun to know a little secret things about me, sharing some of them is potential bad from my side but I don't have problem with truth.

```javascript
console.log(funFacts[0]);
> "Before I've started programming career I was day-trader then designer.";

console.log(funFacts[1]);
> "I almost went bankrupt while trading on stock market in 2018.";

console.log(funFacts[2]);
> "I've destroyed two of my startups, but I'm still trying :D.";

console.log(funFacts[3]);
> "I hate AWS, GCP is underrated.";
```
