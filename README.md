#### Hi, I'm Jay

I don't have real life since I was 15 y.o and discovered programming with Java to build Minecraft mods, actually I'm 20 y.o and I don't have life behind programming, in job I'm Software Enginner and then when I comeback to home I'm trying to help other open-soure projects and build my own projects. Think whatever you want about me.

##### FunFacts[]

- I hate AWS, and I think GCP is underated.
- Addicted to caffeine, ~adderall~, ~ritalin~ and nicotine because healthy life matters.
