I was searching job at **Node.js Developer** position, which would be compatible
with my technology stack and give me some freedom in tools that I'm using. There
was a lot of XD moments.

# The Ecosystem Questions

That's always funny, because I love when people asking things like - what
library you're using to build RESTful APIs - you response `connect` just to be
curious about response and then failing interview because company using
`express`. (real story tho)

> R: Which library would you use to perform HTTP Request in Node.js?
>
> Me: `got`
>
> R: We're using `request` sadly.

> Me: Are you using TypeScript?
>
> R: No we're not using TypeScript, we're using ES6+.
>
> Me: TypeScript compiles to ES3+ so that's a great option for developing secure
> and stable applications since you additionally gets a cool development toolkit
> and strong typing.
>
> R: We've thinked about introducing TypeScript but it don't save us from
> runtime errors so it's useless.

### The DDD Questions

My favourite selection of questions on Node.js position, since from my reseach
most of market don't really know what methods are most productive for specific
project, and there can occur event called **Overhype** where some companies
using Microservices everywhere other ones using DDD everywhere.

> R: Are you famillar with DDD since we're using this in every project.
>
> Me: I'm famillar, but DDD should be not used for every kind of project, it
> just increases complexity in most cases, it's JavaScript not OOP Language,
> it's an simple scripting language.
>
> R: I understand what you have on mind.

Idk, I know I could pass this interview because that was piece of cake, but for
real I don't want to collaborate with company that don't have reason for actions
and decision they take.
