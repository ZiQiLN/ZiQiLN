excerpt: Short useless story about building my own blog (that one), for publishing some no-sense ideas, experiments and other shit related to development.

Last time when I was levelling my character in World of Warcraft, I've got an idea to build my own blog as everybody does, Gatsby.js is a cool library that allows us to do awesome things - so I decided to use Gatsby, and of course I'm lazy as fuck so I decided to use a ready starter instead writing everything from scratch (maybe in future I'll build my own, actually not).

I'll finish that later, this note is useless at fact and this blog isn't dedicated to post shit like that.
